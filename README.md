barch
=====

Barch is intended to be a personal repository for reference management. For the sake of cross-platform portability, it is implemented as a webapp. Current list of features include:

- Import, storage, and export of references in BibTeX format
- Tag references with keywords
- Search for references via tags or bibtex attributes
- Upload files associated with references (alternatively, populate the url or doi fields of references to automatically create links to the source)
- Keep markdown-formatted notes for each reference
