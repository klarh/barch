Barch is intended to be a personal repository for reference management. Current list of features include:

- Import and export of references in a BibTeX-style format
- Tag references with keywords
- Search for references via tags or bibtex attributes
- Upload files associated with references (alternatively, populate the url or doi fields of references to automatically create links)
- Keep markdown-formatted notes for each reference
